 # Statistica - A World Bank API-based service

# Intro


This application renders a graphical representation of data on various social, economic and demographic indicators from nations by their regions. The World Bank is the source of the data fetched in this application and the provider of the APIs used.
I am highly interested in learning about the data and statistics about the socio-economic and demographic indicators of various countries. Graphs are the best way to describe such indicators. Hence, I thought that I should develop an application that helps me access basic graphical info about various indicators without searching on the internet every time. That is how I got the idea to develop this application.
